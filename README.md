# Concrete-Crack-Recongition-Phase-1

This project will explore the use off image recongition for concrete cracks.
Over samples collected from Kaggle, 40,000 images were collected between cracked and uncracked concrete.
Using Python and related libraries, the images will be loaded and cleaned for modeling. 
Little EDA is required as the files are mainly images. Configuration of the image is required to make the data readable for modeling purposes.

CNN will be the primary model to create the recongition.
